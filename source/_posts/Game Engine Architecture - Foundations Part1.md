## (1.2)What is Game?

>In his excellent book, A Theory
of Fun for Game Design **a game to be an interactive experience that provides the player with an increasingly challenging sequence of patterns which he or she learns and eventually masters**.

>游戏： 一个交互性的经历提供一个玩家学习或将要学习的技能的挑战集合（持续提升的）

* soft real-time game & hard real-time game
  soft 意味着deadline不影响玩家，hard往往造成严重的后果。
  

## (1.4) Game genres

### FPS

>first-person shooters aim to provide their players with the illusion of being
immersed in a detailed, hyperrealistic world

>First-person shooters typically focus on technologies such as:
>* efficient rendering of large 3D virtual worlds;
>* a responsive camera control/aiming mechanic;
>* high-fidelity animations of the player’s virtual arms and weapons;
>* a wide range of powerful handheld weaponry;
>* a forgiving player character motion and collision model, which often
gives these games a “floaty” feel;
>* high-fidelity animations and artificial intelligence for the non-player
characters (NPCs)—the player’s enemies and allies; and
>* small-scale online multiplayer capabilities (typically supporting up to
64 simultaneous players), and the ubiquitous “death match” gameplay
mode.

> 高效渲染3D虚拟世界
> 有响应式的相机控制与射击目标指向机制
> 高质量的玩家手臂和武器控制
> 丰富的装备选择
> 丰富的人物动画库和碰撞模型
> 非玩家（NPC）的高质量动作和人工智能
> 小型的多人同屏（<64）和频繁的角色死亡重生的游戏机制

### Platformers and Other Third-Person Games

> Technologies specifically:
> * moving platforms, ladders, ropes, trellises and other interesting locomotion modes;
> * puzzle-like environmental elements;
> * a third-person “follow camera” which stays focused on the player character and whose rotation is typically controlled by the human player via
the right joypad stick (on a console) or the mouse (on a PC—note that
while there are a number of popular third-person shooters on a PC, the
platformer genre exists almost exclusively on consoles); and
> * a complex camera collision system for ensuring that the view point never
“clips” through background geometry or dynamic foreground objects

> 移动平台，楼梯等模块
> 场景的混淆视听的组件
> 第三人称使用的相机跟随
> 复杂的相机机制以显示当前游戏所需的空间

### Fighting Games

> Efforts on:
> * a rich set of fighting animations;
>*  accurate hit detection;
>* a user input system capable of detecting complex button and joystick
>combinations; and
>*  crowds, but otherwise relatively static backgrounds

> State-of-the-art fighting games:
>*  high-definition character graphics, including realistic skin shaders with
subsurface scattering and sweat effects;
>* high-fidelity character animations; and
>*  physics-based cloth and hair simulations for the characters.

> 丰富的对战性的动画集
> 精准的碰撞检测
> 连招所用的组合键设计
> 观众相关的人群背景设计

> 高质量的人物画面及皮肤shader支持
> 高质量的动画
> 头发衣服的模拟


### Racing Games
>Some of the technological properties of a typical racing game include the
following techniques:
>* Various “tricks” are used when rendering distant background elements,
such as employing two-dimensional cards for trees, hills and mountains.
>* The track is often broken down into relatively simple two-dimensional
regions called “sectors.” These data structures are used to optimize
rendering and visibility determination, to aid in artificial intelligence
and path finding for non-human-controlled vehicles, and to solve many
other technical problems.
>*The camera typically follows behind the vehicle for a third-person perspective, or is sometimes situated inside the cockpit first-person style.
>*When the track involves tunnels and other “tight” spaces, a good deal
of effort is often put into ensuring that the camera does not collide with
background geometry

>  背景元素的各种2D的以假乱真的方法
>  赛道的设计，使用2维的Sectors的数据结构，用于优化渲染和视觉效果，也可辅助设计AI的寻路等
>  相机的视角以塞车后方的第三方人称或驾驶室的第一人称角色

### Real-Time Strategy(RTS)

> Include the following techniques:
>* Each unit is relatively low-res, so that the game can support large numbers of them on-screen at once.
>* Height-field terrain is usually the canvas upon which the game is designed and played.
>* The player is often allowed to build new structures on the terrain in
addition to deploying his or her forces.
>* User interaction is typically via single-click and area-based selection of
units, plus menus or toolbars containing commands, equipment, unit
types, building types, etc.

> 每一个单元都占有相对少的资源，以便支持更多单元的同屏
> 高地的地型常用于场景中
> 玩家可自己支配自己的势力在地图，如创建一些建筑等
> 交互模式传统上来说是用单击或区域选择


### Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMO)

>* An MMO is defined as any game that supports huge numbers of
simultaneous players (from thousands to hundreds of thousands), usually all
playing in one very large, persistent virtual world (i.e., a world whose internal
state persists for very long periods of time, far beyond that of any one player’s
gameplay session). 
>* Hence, perhaps the most important
role of the central server is to handle the billing and micro-transactions which
serve as the game developer’s primary source of revenue.
> MMO：支持超多在线在在一个虚拟世界中游玩的游戏
> 分类有MMORPG,MMORTS, MMOFPS
> 核心在于服务器的强大。

### Player-Authored Content
> 以玩家为主的游戏模式，代表性如我的世界，Little Big Planet2


### Other Genres

> sports
> RPG
> God games, e.g. Populous 
> Social simulation games , e.g. SimCity
> puzzle game , e.g.Tetris
> non-electronic games
> web-based game

## (1.5) Game Engine Survey

### The Quake Family of Engines
1992 Written by Id Software. 

Quake , Quake II source code is freely available!

### The Unreal Family of Engines

Major competitor to Quake from 1998 written by Epic Games, Inc.
2004 UE2. 
> Unreal is an incredibly powerful prototyping
tool and commercial game development platform, and it can be used to build
virtually any 3D first-person or third-person game (not to mention games in
other genres as well).

> Epic now offers full access to Unreal Engine 4, source code and
all, for a low monthly subscription fee plus a cut of your game’s profits if it
ships. This makes UE4 a viable choice for small independent game studios.

### The Half-Life Source Engine

> Source is a high-quality engine, rivaling Unreal Engine 4 in terms of graphics capabilities and tool set.

### DICE's Frostbite
寒霜

 >DICE's efforts to create a game engine for Battlefield Bad Company in 2006! Frostbite boasts a powerful unified asset creation tool called
FrostEd, a powerful tools pipeline known as Backend Services, and a powerful
runtime game engine.

### CryEngine

>Crytek originally developed their powerful game engine known as CryENGINE as a tech demo for Nvidia.


### Sony's PhyreEngine


>In an effort to make developing games for Sony’s PlayStation 3 platform more
accessible, Sony introduced PhyreEngine at the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in 2008.
>It is available free of charge to any licensed Sony developer as part of the PlayStation SDK

>为了针对sony ps3平台更好的开发游戏，2008年在GDC大会上推出
