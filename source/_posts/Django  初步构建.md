### Generic View
>　简化写法，可选的有generic.IndexView和generic.DetailView
>　By default, the DetailView generic view uses a template called <app name>/<model name>_detail.html
>　
>  In our case, it would use the template "polls/question_detail.html". The template_name attribute is used to tell Django to use a specific template name instead of the autogenerated default template name. We also specify the template_name for the results list view – this ensures that the results view and the detail view have a different appearance when rendered, even though they’re both a DetailView behind the scenes.
